export const HERO_CONTENT = `I am a passionate frontend developer with a foundation in crafting robust and scalable web applications. Although I don't have professional work experience, I have gained substantial practical experience through personal projects and intensive courses from CyberBionic Systematics. I have honed my skills in front-end technologies like React, TypeScript, and Tailwind, and I also have some experience with Angular. In the future, I would like to become a full stack developer. My goal is to leverage my expertise to create innovative solutions that drive business growth and deliver exceptional user experiences.`;

export const ABOUT_TEXT = `I studied at the National Transport University, where I earned a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, followed by a Master's degree in the same field. Among various programming disciplines, web development captivated me the most. Throughout my studies, my focus remained on this area, and I actively explored and practiced it. However, feeling stuck, I decided to enhance my skills through formal courses.

After completing a comprehensive front-end specialist course that covered everything from basics to working with the Angular framework, I explored the React library. Its appeal led me to shift my focus to React, where I continue to develop my expertise.

I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy solving complex problems to deliver high-quality solutions. Outside of coding, I enjoy staying active, exploring new technologies.`;
